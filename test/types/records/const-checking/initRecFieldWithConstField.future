bug: should be able to init record fields that have const fields

If a record has a const field, we should still be able to store
members of it and to initialize that field, but our current reliance
on assignment for record initialization shows that we can't do this
today.

The prevailing theory is that this is due to the fact that the record
doesn't define an initializer and so today is getting a
compiler-generated _constructor_ which doesn't support copy
initialization.  The theory is that once the compiler is generating
initializers, all will be better.  That said, I can't seem to get the
test working by providing an explicit initializer either.
