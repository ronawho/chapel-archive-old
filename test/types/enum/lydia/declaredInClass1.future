bug: enums declared in class scope can't have fields use their constants via explicit naming

The spec says that it is legal to declare an enum within the top level scope of
a class (as well as classes, records, and unions).  However, trying to use one
of the constants declared in that enum as the initial value of field runs into
issues.

This future covers trying to use a constant with explicit naming.
