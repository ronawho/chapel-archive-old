bug: A nested class captures outer record by value rather than ref

When defining a class within a record, the class should have
a reference to the enclosing record so that it can access
the outer fields.

There is a bug in the compiler that causes instances of
the class to get a copy of the outer record at the time
the class is constructed.

In this test we can see two uses of R.deinit(); one for
the R defined in doit() and the other for the copy.
