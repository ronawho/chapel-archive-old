bug: issue with using nil as the default value for an initializer class argument

Our creation of the _new function appears to behave incorrectly when one of the
arguments for the initializer is only given a default value of nil and no type
is involved.

This shouldn't be too difficult to fix.

When this future is resolved, we can convert test/users/shetag/objRefAsFormArg
to use initializers instead of constructors.
