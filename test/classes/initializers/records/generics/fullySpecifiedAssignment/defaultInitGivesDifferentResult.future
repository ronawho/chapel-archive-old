bug: fully specified assignment leads to weird behavior with mismatched init()

I expected this program to make rec of type MyRec(5), and then properly return
the result of `new MyRec(3)`, which is of type MyRec(5).  Or to make rec of type
MyRec(7) and then get an error trying to assign the result of MyRec(5) into it.
Instead, neither of those things happened: rec is of type MyRec(7), and for some
reason this doesn't cause issues ...
