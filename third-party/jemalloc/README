jemalloc README for Chapel
==========================

This copy of jemalloc 5.0.1 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from:

  https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to jemalloc should be
directed to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.


Upgrading jemalloc versions
===========================

TODO update instructions to include running with --enable-debug for configs,
and maybe running `make check` across compilers and platforms?

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/jemalloc/jemalloc-src contains the
un-tarballed jemalloc package contents. Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/jemalloc/:

1. download and untar the latest jemalloc version: e.g. jemalloc-5.0.1
2. `rm -rf jemalloc-src`
3. `mv jemalloc-5.0.1 jemalloc-src`
4. `git add --force jemalloc-src` (--force to ignore our .gitignore)
5. update the version number mentioned above
6. verify the references to jemalloc's man page in the runtime shim are
   accurate and update the version number referenced.
7. make sure these instructions are up to date :)
8. test (std config, and at least one that requires a shared-heap)
9. commit, PR, merge, etc

Note that these instructions are for a simple API compatible updates. If the
jemalloc API changes, or the references to the man page in the runtime shim are
no longer accurate, more care should be taken to see what changes have been
made and if we need to change anything on our end.


Upgrading to jemalloc 5.0 issues:
=================================

It seems we can no longer replace the allocation hooks for arena 0
